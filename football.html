        <p><strong>Ronaldo to hang up his boots</strong><br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo has said he will retire from international football after the 2022 World Cup, by which time he is almost certain to have broken more records, including becoming the standalone leading goal scorer in international football -- he is currently tied on 109 with former Iran forward Ali Daei.Portugal sit on top of UEFA qualifying Group A going into the September fixtures and look well set to seal a spot in Qatar and give Ronaldo the global send-off he deserves.

            Borussia Dortmund striker Haaland has already taken the club game by storm, both in the Bundesliga and Champions League, but he faces a challenge to qualify for the World Cup with Norway. After three games in six-team Group G, Norway sit fourth, but they are just a point behind leaders Turkey.</p>

        <p><strong>Transfer rumours</strong><br><br>Manchester United are 'getting serious' in their pursuit of Bayer Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka, according to reports.

            With only Tom Heaton officially signed so far, it's been a quiet start to the summer for United but it could soon burst to life with the imminent arrival of Jadon Sancho and with a deal for Raphael Varane edging closer.
            
            Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not satisfied there, however, and still wants to bring a new centre-midfielder to the club this summer to enhance his ranks.
            
            Declan Rice is the ideal target but with the 22 year old still having three years left on his contract at West Ham, any move may be difficult to pull off - not to mention extremely expensive.
            
            Added to the fact that Paul Pogba's future is not certain either, United may well still be looking to add a new midfielder by the time next summer's window opens - at which point and should they so desire, they may be able to swoop for Bayern star Gortezka, who would then be available on a free.</p>
